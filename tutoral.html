<h2>Prepare The Sponge</h2>
<p>Put some sopa on top of the sponge and make lateher. </p>
<p>Start the dishes from smallest to biggest, so it will be easier at the end</p>
<h2>The Post-Wash Wash.</h2>
<p>Once all of your dishes have been cleaned and your sink is empty, rinse out the inside of the sink</p>
