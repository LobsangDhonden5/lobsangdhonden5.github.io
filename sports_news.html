          <h2>Reeling Blues lose injured Jay Bouwmeester for rest of season </h2>
        </center>

        <b><p><big>The free-falling St. Louis Blues will be without defenceman Jay Bouwmeester for the rest of the season with a left hip injury.<b></p></big>

<big><p><b>General manager Doug Armstrong said Bouwmeester will be sidelined four to six months and that forward Scottie Upshall will be re-evaluated in four weeks after suffering a knee injury.</big></p><b>

<b><p><big>St. Louis has lost eight of its past 10 games to fall out of the top three in the Central Division and out of a playoff position entirely in the Western Conference.</big></p><b>

<b><p><big>The 34-year-old Bouwmeester has only dressed in 35 games this season and has two goals and five assists. But the Edmonton native was averaging 20 minutes a game when in the lineup, ice time the Blues will have to make up for.</big></p><b>

<b><p><big>Upshall, who injured a knee Saturday against Dallas, has seven goals and 11 assists in 61 games.</big></p><b>
