          <h2>Reeling Blues lose injured Jay Bouwmeester for rest of season </h2>
        </center>

        <b><p><big>The free-falling St. Louis Blues will be without defenceman Jay Bouwmeester for the rest of the season with a left hip injury.<b></p></big>

<big><p><b>General manager Doug Armstrong said Bouwmeester will be sidelined four to six months and that forward Scottie Upshall will be re-evaluated in four weeks after suffering a knee injury.</big></p><b>

<b><p><big>St. Louis has lost eight of its past 10 games to fall out of the top three in the Central Division and out of a playoff position entirely in the Western Conference.</big></p><b>

<b><p><big>The 34-year-old Bouwmeester has only dressed in 35 games this season and has two goals and five assists. But the Edmonton native was averaging 20 minutes a game when in the lineup, ice time the Blues will have to make up for.</big></p><b>

<b><p><big>Upshall, who injured a knee Saturday against Dallas, has seven goals and 11 assists in 61 games.</big></p><b>

<h2>Indian Wells: Novak Djokovic beaten by world number 109 Taro Daniel</h2>
<p>Novak Djokovic suffered a shock defeat by world number 109 Taro Daniel of Japan as he was knocked out of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old lost 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-1 in the second-round tie on his first appearance since an injury ended his Australian Open challenge in January.</p>
<p>Djokovic had further surgery on a persistent elbow injury in February.</p>
<p>"It felt like first match I ever played on the tour. Very weird. I completely lost rhythm," said the Serb.</p>
<p>"I was grateful to be out on the court after surgery that quickly but at the same time I just didn't feel good at all."</p>
<p>"I was not even supposed to be here because of the surgery that was only five, six weeks ago. But I recovered very quickly, and I got myself ready."</p>
<p>The defeat was just the fifth time in the past decade former world number one Djokovic has lost against a player outside the top 100 players in the world.

Daniel was victorious after two hours and 30 minutes, and benefitted from 61 unforced errors from Djokovic, who has won 12 Grand Slam singles titles.</p>
<p>"He obviously wasn't in his top form," Daniel said. "So I was able to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>"And even if I lost the second set, I still had faith I could pull something off in the third. I was able to stay pretty tough, so I'm pretty proud of that.</p>
<p>"I played the best set of the whole match and that was really good."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, world number one Roger Federer booked his place in the third round with a 6-3 7-6 (8-6) victory over Argentina's Federico Delbonis.

The match was carried over from Saturday after rain force play to end early with Federer one set up and the scores locked at 2-2 in the second.

Federer saved a set point in the second-set tie-break before easing through.</p>

<h2>Harry Kane injury concern for Tottenham Hotspur & England</h2>
<b><p><big>England striker Harry Kane will have a scan on Monday on the ankle injury he suffered during Tottenham's 4-1 win over Bournemouth.</big></p><b>
<b><p><big>Kane, 24, was substituted 30 minutes into Sunday's match after injuring his right ankle in a collision with home keeper Asmir Begovic.</big></p><b>
<b><p><big>He immediately left the field and went straight down the tunnel.</big></p><b>
<b><p><big>Spurs meet Swansea on Saturday in the FA Cup, with England playing two friendly matches in the following week.

Gareth Southgate's men travel to the Netherlands on Friday, 23 March before hosting Italy on 27 March, with the squad being named on Thursday.</big></p><b>
<b><p><big>And Pochettino added: "It's the same ankle he suffered with before. He landed and twisted his ankle. He's positive, he's happy with the victory for the team."

England forward Dele Alli was also substituted after picking up a groin injury - and the Spurs boss said: "I don't believe it's a big issue, we have to manage him."</big></p><b>
<b><p><big>Last season, Kane missed 10 games for his club after suffering ligament damage to his right ankle in Spurs' Premier League win at Sunderland in September.

He also missed two of England's World Cup qualifiers - a 2-0 win over against Malta in Gareth Southgate's first game in interim charge and a goalless draw against Slovenia.

Kane, who has scored 35 goals for Spurs this season, then injured the same ankle again on 12 March 2017, in Tottenham's FA Cup quarter-final victory over Millwall.

On that occasion he missed four weeks of action, including England's 1-0 friendly defeat against Germany and a 2-0 win over Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier.</big></p><b>
